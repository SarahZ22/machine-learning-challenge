#### Background
Over a period of nine years in deep space, the NASA Kepler space telescope has been out on a planet-hunting mission to discover hidden planets outside of our solar system. To help process this data, you will create machine learning models capable of classifying candidate exoplanets from the raw dataset.

Data From: https://www.kaggle.com/nasa/kepler-exoplanet-search-results

##### Project Requirements:
Preprocess the raw data \
Tune the models \
Compare two or more models
